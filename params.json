{"name":"PicoChess","tagline":"Stand alone chess computer based on DGT board","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe goal the this project is to create a dedicated chess computer based on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), the [Stockfish chess engine](http://www.stockfishchess.com), the [DGT eboard and DGT XL Clock](http://www.dgtprojects.com/) or the Piface display.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uw57fAjEjDs/UHTKNhEuIVI/AAAAAAAAABQ/WT_rY9-uNss/s1600/IMGP3046.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis project mainly supports the Raspberry Pi (now with Piface and tablebase support). The [ODROID-X](http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php) is also supported for expert users. The Rikomagic MK 802 II is no longer supported. Old Rikomagic images are maintained for historical sake. Also, it's possible to run PicoChess on a desktop computer (Linux, OSX, Windows).\r\n\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3042900/picochess_slovenia_gms.jpg)\r\n\r\nPicochess vs Slovenian GMs Top Slovenian GMs - (from left to right) GM Jure Škoberne, GM Luka Lenič, GM Duško Pavasović, and GM Matej Šebenik after a casual tag team session vs Picochess at Jonas's chess shop.

And there is a lot of space (1GB) for the hastables. Picochess is the strongest on the O-Droidx (4 core ARM processor). You can also play with a remote chess engine (on a desktop PC or a 32-core amazon instance).\r\n\r\n# Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n* Is the bluetooth DGT board supported ?\r\nYes, but only in bluetooth mode. You need a USB to bluetooth adapter. If you are not using the piface version refer to Regular Bluetooth instructions. If you are using the piface version refer to Piface Bluetooth instructions.\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to join the [PicoChess mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/picochess), especially if you want to help for help testing or [documenting](http://docs.picochess.org). If you have new feature requests, send these to the mailing list too.\r\n\r\nYou have better chances to have quick answers on the PicoChess group, but you can also write us for all questions :\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3042900/devs_pico_email.png)\r\n","google":"UA-34439076-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
